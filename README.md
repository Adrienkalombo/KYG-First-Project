KYG-First-Project
=================
The purpose is to create a solid app that is somewhat functional for someone with the type of skill sets I have.

The expectation of this project is just to get confortable using the many tools at my disposal and also show what i have learned so far.

In this project I will be creating an App called "Know Your Geography‚Äù. It is an app that randomly generate countries names from the continent of Europe. Once is the countries name is generated then it will asks three sets of questions.

Country
France

Questions about France

Pick the right answer.  Languages   1.English  2.French  3.Polish
      Capital city    1. Paris     2.Brussels 3. Munich
      Flag?      i will have flags pick from which the player can pick..

However, i will add more complexity to it later once a working model.

Phase 1:   Gather information about what type of tools i can use  and where i can get a spreadsheet of European countries which has capital cities name, flags and languages.
Phase 2:    Gather establish my model relationships, because that will either break or help the smoothness of the App.

Phase 3:  to utilize all the assembled pieces from phase 1 and 2 and make it all work..


The purpose is this project to get build an app with few functionalities from ground up and to have to ability to enlarge the scope of  functionalities as learn more about application building methods and tools.

I expect it to somewhat dissent based on my standard, but the struggle will be real..
